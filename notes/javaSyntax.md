# Java Syntax

> Java is case sensitive. MyClass and myclass would be treated as two completely different names.

> The name of the Java file must match the class name. So, if your class is called Main, the file must be saved as Main.java. If the names don't match, Java will give an error and the program will not run.

> The main() method is required in every Java program. It's where the program starts running. Any code placed in the main() method will be executed.

---

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
```

> The curly braces {} mark the beginning and the end of a block of code. System is a built-in Java class. out is a member of System, short for "output" println() is a method, short for "print line".

> Remember that every Java statement must end with a semicolon.
